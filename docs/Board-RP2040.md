# RP2040 / RP2350 Boards

## Arduino IDE Setup

_madflight_ for RP2350/RP2040 requires [arduino-pico v4.x.x or later](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) (Note: for fast SDIO SDCARD arduino-pico v5.x.x is required.)

Start the Arduino IDE and select menu **Tools->Board Manager** to install arduino-pico.

Set menu **Tools->Operating System** to "FreeRTOS SMP"

## PlatformIO Setup

1. Clone or download a madflight release to your harddisk

2. Start PlatformIO and open folder `madflight/examples`

Note: RP2040/RP2350 is not merged into mainline PlatformIO, see [here](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platformio.html). On Windows you need to enable long path names, see previous link for instructions.

To enable uploading on Windows you need to use [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) - Connect a RP2 device whist holding the boot button, then in Zadig select "RP2 Boot (Interface 1) and install the WinUSB driver. See [here](https://community.platformio.org/t/cannot-upload-to-raspberry-pi-pico/45936/2)


## Pinout Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico2

This is the default pinout for RP2040 and RP2350. It is optimized for Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico2 (40 pin) boards. This pinout is defined`brd/default_RP2040.h`, but can be modified with `madflight_config` configuration settings in your program.

## RP2040/RP2350 Hardware

RP2350 (Raspberry Pi Pico2) is newer and a lot more powerful than RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico).

RP2350 has dual core processor, plus dual single precision FPUs.

RP2040 has dual core processor, but no FPUs.

_madflight_ uses float and is much happier with RP2350 than with RP2040 !

_madflight_ uses a custom Serial library, because the default Arduino Serial transmitter blocks after sending a couple bytes. Something we don't want.

_madflight_ uses FreeRTOS and executes the 1000Hz IMU loop on the second core. The first core is used for the other sensors.

## madflight Limitiations

- OUT: Consecutive even/odd PWM pins (e.g. pins 2,3 or 10,11) share the same timer and have the same frequency.
