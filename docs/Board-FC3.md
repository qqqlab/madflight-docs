This is a Raspberry Pi Pico2 on steroids. Use it as a flight controller, or for a project that requires precise orientation sensing with the on-board 10DOF best-in-class sensors. 

The layout of the pins is similar to the Raspberry Pi Pico2, but with added 5V power pins to make it easy to connect external components like RC receivers, GPS with compass, 4-in-1 ESC, Servos, Radars, etc. 

Easy mounting: Use the standard 30.5mm x 30.5mm mounting holes to fit your drone frame. Or use double sided tape to mount the board, the board has no components on the back.

Power the board directly from 3 ~ 6V (eg. USB or 1S LiPo), or use the included DC-DC converter to connect larger batteries. For added flexibility the DC-DC converter board can be top or bottom mounted.

Even when using all interal functions, the external pins can be used for:

- 22 PWM pins
- 8 DSHOT pins
- 6 Serial Ports (2 Hardware + 4 PIO UARTs)
- 1 I2C Port
- 1 SPI Port
- 6 ADC pins

## Arduino IDE Setup

_madflight_ for RP2350/RP2040 requires [arduino-pico v4.x.x or later](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) (Note: for fast SDIO SDCARD arduino-pico v5.x.x is required.)

Start the Arduino IDE and select menu **Tools->Board Manager** to install arduino-pico.

Set menu **Tools->Operating System** to "FreeRTOS SMP"

For programming, select board "Solder Party RP2350 Stamp XL"

## PlatformIO Setup

1. Clone or download a madflight release to your harddisk

2. Start PlatformIO and open folder `madflight/examples`

3. Compile env:rp2350b

Note: RP2040/RP2350 is not merged into mainline PlatformIO, see [here](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platformio.html). On Windows you need to enable long path names, see previous link for instructions.

## Pinout FC3

This is the default FC3 configuration, but the external pins can be freely reconfigured. 

Use `#include <madflight_FC3.h>` instead of `#include <madflight_board.h>` to include this pinout.

## RP2350B Hardware

RP2350B is the 80 pin / 48 GPIO variant of the Raspberry Pi RP2350 processor.

RP2350 has dual core processors, plus dual single precision FPUs.

_madflight_ uses float and is much happier with RP2350 than with RP2040 !

_madflight_ uses a custom Serial library, because the default Arduino Serial transmitter blocks after sending a couple bytes. Something we don't want.

_madflight_ uses FreeRTOS and executes the 1000Hz IMU loop on the second core. The first core is used for the other sensors.

## madflight Limitiations

- OUT: Consecutive even/odd PWM pins (e.g. pins 2,3 or 10,11) share the same timer and have the same frequency.
