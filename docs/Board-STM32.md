# STM32 Boards

## Arduino IDE Setup

_madflight_ for STM32 requires:

- [STM32duino Arduino Core for STM32 v2.x.x](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32) Start the Arduino IDE and select menu Tools->Board Manager to install this software.

- [STM32duino FreeRTOS](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32FreeRTOS) Select menu Tools->Manage Libaries, then search for "STM32duino FreeRTOS".


## PlatformIO Setup

1. Start PlatformIO, go to PIO Home, and press the "New Project" button.

2. Select your ESP32-S3/ESP32 board, and use the Arduino framework, click "Finish".

3. Overwrite the main.cpp file with one of the _madflight_ examples, and copy the madflight_config.h file to the src directory.

4. Adapt the platformio.ini file as follows:

```ini
; PlatformIO Project Configuration File for madflight

[env]
lib_deps = qqqlab/madflight

[env:YOUR_STM32_BOARD]
...

; NOTES:
;
; For the latest madflight development version use
; lib_deps = https://github.com/qqqlab/madflight.git
;
; For a particular madflight branch/tag use
; lib_deps = https://github.com/qqqlab/madflight.git#v2.0.1
```
## Pinout STM32 Commercial Flight Controllers

In the `src` directory you'll find 400+ Betaflight configuration files for commercial flight controllers. Include the madflight_board_XXX.h header file of your board, and in your program override settings as needed to match your board. 

The Betaflight configuration files are manually generated by a Python script in the 'extras' folder. If your favorite board is missing, run the script to add it.

## Pinout STM32F411 Black Pill

This is the default pinout for STM32. It is optimized for the WeAct STM32F411 Black Pill (40 pin) board. This pinout is defined in madflight_board__STM32.h,  but can be modified with _madflight_ _pin_xxx_ configuration settings in your program.

## STM32 Hardware

The STM32 MCU family is a huge collection of chips. _madflight_ will run on most stm32duino supported F4, F7, H7 and similar chips, preferred are STM32H743 and STM32F405.

Most supported STM32 targets have a single core MCU with FPU. 

FreeRTOS is required for _madflight_ v1.3 and later.

_madflight_ for STM32 runs the IMU loop by default in interrupt context.

## madflight Limitiations

- Serial Ports: Standard 64 buffer is too small for GPS/MAVLink -> Set `#define SERIAL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE 256` and `#define SERIAL_TX_BUFFER_SIZE 256` in HardwareSerial.h
- OUT: STM32duino PWM drivers have 1 us resolution, too coarse for OneShot
- OUT: PWM pins with shared timer have same frequency
- BBX: SDCARD (not implemented yet)
