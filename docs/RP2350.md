# RP2350 and RP2040

madflight works with [arduino-pico v4.x.x](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico)

## RP2350 and RP2040 Hardware

RP2350 (Raspberry Pi Pico2) is newer and a lot more powerful than RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico).

#### Dual Core / FPU

RP2350 has dual core, dual single precision FPU.

RP2040 has dual core, no FPU.

madflight uses float and is much happier with RP2350 than with RP2040 !

#### FreeRTOS

madflight on RP2040 uses FreeRTOS and executes the 1000Hz IMU loop on the second core, which is 80% loaded at default 133MHz CPU speed. You can overclock the CPU to get some more headroom.

#### PWM

Consecutive even/odd PWM pins (e.g. pins 2,3 or 10,11) share the same timer and have the same frequency.

#### Serial

madflight uses a custom high performance SerialIRQ library.

## Pinout Raspberry Pi Pico2 / Raspberry Pi Pico 

This is the default pinout for RP2350 and RP2040. It is optimized for Raspberry Pi Pico2 / Raspberry Pi Pico (40 pin) boards. This pinout is defined in madflight_board_default_RP2040.h, but can be modified with `#define HW_PIN_XXX` in your program.

## Pinout RP2040-Zero

This pinout is optimized for the RP2040-Zero (21 pin) board. This pinout is defined in madflight_board_RP2040-Zero.h, but can be modified with `#define HW_PIN_XXX` in your program.
